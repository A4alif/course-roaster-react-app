# Course Registration ( [Live Site](https://www.example.com) )



## Features

- The user chooses a course, and its price and credit are added to their cart.
- The user can't select a course more than once.
- The user has a 20 credit limit. If total credit goes up to 20, then an alert box will come up.


## Discussion about how I manage the states
- Firstly, I need to fetch all the data from my data.json file and store it in the component. When I need to store something in the component, I have to use the useState hook. 

- When the user clicks the select button, I need to store the specific course details in an array. For that, I need one more useState hook.

- After that, I need to figure out the total price or credit and how much credit I have left to store each and every piece of data. I need to use the useState hook to store that information in the component.
